\LHead{The Theory} \\
There is a directed graph $G = (V, E)$ and a set of edge labels:
\begin{multicols}{2}
In a \emph{functional routing network} the edge labels are
functions on a semilattice $(S, \oplus, \leq)$, which can be
\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{extensive}, if $\id_S \leq f$,
  \item \emph{right-inclining}, if $g \leq f \circ g$ for all $g \in F$,
  \item \emph{left-inclining}, if $f \leq f \circ g$ for all $g \in F$, and
  \item \emph{distributive}, if $f \circ (g \oplus h) = (f \circ g) \oplus (f \circ h)$
  for all $g, h \in F$.
\end{itemize}
In an \emph{algebraic routing network} the edge labels are elements from a semiring structure $(S, \oplus, \otimes, \leq, \nul, \eins)$, for example a \emph{bounded dioid}:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $(S, \oplus, \otimes, \nul, \eins)$ is a semiring
  \item $\leq$ is the partial order of the semilattice $(S, \oplus)$,
  \item $\oplus$ is idempotent, i.e.\ $a \oplus a = a$, and
  \item $\eins \oplus a = a \oplus \eins = \eins$.
\end{itemize}
\end{multicols}
Problem: Find a best paths between two vertices w.r.t.~the partial order $\leq$ of the semilattice given a starting value.

\emph{Profile search}: Find best paths for all starting values.

\textbf{Theorem about profile searches}:
The profile searches on functional routing networks with
\emph{extensive, inclining and distributive}
functions are algebraic routing problems on \emph{bounded dioids}.

\LHead{Conclusions and Future Work} \\
First tests yielded reasonable results, but we just started to implement
various shortest path algorithms for the state-based routing problem and
its profile version. Hence runtime and space analyzations are near future
goals. The model itself is promising, comprising time-dependent routing,
battery constraints, stochasticity and multi-criteria routing, but the
running time is an important question to answer soon.

In the long run we aim to extend GreenNav by more sophisticated algorithms
and services. An egoistic routing algorithm is but the first step towards
ecological sustainability. Multi-modality and stochasticity are two important
points to consider.
